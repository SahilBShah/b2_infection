# b2_infection

##Correlate (enrichment) B2 SINE position to mRNA isoform difference
###If we can figure this out?
###B2 position to expression - isoform and gene level
##Comparison of how many genes are DE in Brf1 KD vs. Ctrl Inf. and how many have B2 in them?
##How many genes have B2s in them in the genome?
##How many genes are induced during infection contain a B2 SINE?
###Highlight based on B2 SINE position in gene
###Volcano plot
##How many genes are induced during infection in a Pol3-dependent manner?
###Ctrl inf vs Ctrl mock
###Brf1 vs Ctrl inf.
###Bar graph to display this data
###At isoform level too - use all mRNA isoforms % as reference
##Look at the background distribution of B2 SINEs and compare it to our empirical data
##Is there a stop codon in the mRNA isoforms with retained introns?
##Send Azra isoform usage data w/ B2 location and gene
##GO term with DE isoforms with a B2
##Average size of B2 SINE?
###Intact B2 = ~180bp
##Distance analyses?
###Eg. distance of B2 SINE from nearest exon and its effect on mRNA isoform
